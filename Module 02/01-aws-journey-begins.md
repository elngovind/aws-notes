# MyLearning.com's AWS Journey Begins

## Chapter 6: The AWS Decision (Late 2020)

### The Research Phase
After the devastating server crash during JEE season, Amit spent weeks researching cloud providers. The team evaluated three major options:

```
Cloud Provider Comparison:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Feature         │  AWS    │  Azure  │  Google Cloud        │
│  ────────────────│─────────│─────────│──────────────────────│
│  Market Share    │   32%   │   20%   │        9%            │
│  Services        │  200+   │  100+   │       100+           │
│  Global Reach    │   26    │   60+   │        27            │
│  Pricing         │ Complex │ Simple  │      Simple          │
│  Learning Curve  │  Steep  │ Medium  │      Medium          │
│  Job Market      │  High   │ Medium  │      Growing         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why AWS Won
1. **Market Leadership**: Largest cloud provider with proven track record
2. **Service Breadth**: 200+ services covering every possible need
3. **Global Infrastructure**: Extensive network for international expansion
4. **Community**: Largest developer community and learning resources
5. **Enterprise Adoption**: Used by Netflix, Airbnb, and other tech giants

### The Team's Concerns
```
Initial Fears & Concerns:
├── Raj (CTO): "AWS seems too complex, so many services!"
├── Priya (CPO): "Will our users notice the migration?"
├── Amit (CEO): "What if we exceed the budget?"
└── Team: "Do we have the skills to manage AWS?"
```

## Chapter 7: Understanding the Global Landscape (December 2020)

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Chapter 8: The Infrastructure Deep Dive (January 2021)

### Learning About AWS Regions
The team spent weeks understanding AWS infrastructure:

#### Initial Confusion
*"Wait, what's the difference between a Region and an Availability Zone?"* - Raj

*"And what are these Edge Locations? Are they the same as Regions?"* - Priya

*"How do we choose the right region for our users?"* - Amit

#### The Learning Process
```
Team Learning Journey:
├── Week 1: AWS Documentation
│   ├── Read about Regions and AZs
│   ├── Understand Edge Locations
│   └── Learn about specialized services
├── Week 2: Hands-on Exploration
│   ├── Created AWS account
│   ├── Explored different regions
│   └── Tested latency from India
├── Week 3: Architecture Planning

│   ├── Planned data replication
│   └── Estimated costs
└── Week 4: Decision Making
    ├── Selected primary regions
    ├── Chose deployment strategy
    └── Created migration timeline
```

### The "Aha!" Moment
During a late-night planning session, the team finally understood the power of AWS global infrastructure:

*"It's like having data centers around the world, but we don't have to build or manage them!"* - Raj

*"And our users will get the same fast experience whether they're in Mumbai or Dubai!"* - Priya

*"The best part? We only pay for what we use in each region!"* - Amit

## Chapter 9: The Account Setup Journey (February 2021)

## Chapter 10: The IAM Awakening (March 2021)

### The Security Wake-up Call
One morning, Raj received an alarming email from AWS:

*"Unusual activity detected in your account. Multiple EC2 instances launched in regions you don't typically use."*

**The Investigation**: Someone had gained access to their AWS account and was mining cryptocurrency using their credentials!

**The Damage**: ₹45,000 in unexpected charges in just 2 days.
