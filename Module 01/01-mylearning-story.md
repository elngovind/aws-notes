# The MyLearning.com Journey

## Chapter 1: The Beginning (2018)

### The Founders
Three college friends - Raj (Developer), Priya (Designer), and Amit (Business) - noticed students struggling with expensive coaching classes and decided to create an affordable online learning platform.

### Initial Setup
- **Budget**: ₹2 lakhs from savings
- **Infrastructure**: Single dedicated server from local provider
- **Team**: 3 founders working from Raj's apartment
- **Users**: 50 beta users from their college

### Early Challenges
- Server crashes during peak hours (evening study time)
- Manual backups every night
- Single point of failure
- Limited to 100 concurrent users
- High maintenance costs

## Chapter 2: Growth Pains (2019)

### Rapid Growth
- User base grew to 5,000 students
- Added video streaming for lectures
- Introduced live doubt-solving sessions

### Infrastructure Problems
- **Server Overload**: Frequent crashes during exam seasons
- **Storage Issues**: Video content consuming massive space
- **Bandwidth Costs**: ₹50,000/month just for bandwidth
- **Downtime**: 15-20% monthly downtime affecting user trust
- **Scaling**: Adding new servers took 2-3 weeks

### The Breaking Point
During JEE preparation season, the platform crashed for 6 hours straight, losing 500 premium subscribers and damaging reputation.

## Chapter 3: The Cloud Discovery (2020)

### Research Phase
Amit attended an AWS webinar and learned about cloud computing benefits:
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling based on demand
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime guarantee
- **Cost**: Pay-as-you-use model
- **Global Reach**: Content delivery worldwide

### Decision Factors
- Traditional setup would cost ₹15 lakhs for next phase
- Cloud migration estimated at ₹3 lakhs with better features
- Reduced time-to-market for new features

## Chapter 4: Cloud Transformation (2021)

### Migration Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Move static content to AWS S3 and CloudFront
- **Phase 2**: Migrate application to EC2 with Auto Scaling
- **Phase 3**: Database migration to RDS with Multi-AZ
- **Phase 4**: Implement CI/CD pipeline

### Results After Migration
- **Uptime**: Improved to 99.95%
- **Cost Reduction**: 40% reduction in infrastructure costs
- **Performance**: 60% faster content delivery globally
- **Scalability**: Handled 50,000 concurrent users during peak

## Chapter 5: Innovation & Growth (2022-2024)

### Advanced Cloud Adoption
- **AI/ML Integration**: Personalized learning paths using Amazon SageMaker
- **Microservices**: Containerized architecture with EKS
- **Serverless**: Lambda functions for real-time notifications
- **Global Expansion**: Multi-region deployment

### Current Status
- **Users**: 2 million active learners
- **Revenue**: ₹50 crores annually
- **Team**: 200+ employees
- **Presence**: 15 countries
- **Infrastructure Cost**: 25% of revenue (vs 45% in traditional setup)
