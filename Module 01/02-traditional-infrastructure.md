### Key Challenges Faced

#### 1. Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Issues
- **Initial Investment**: ₹8 lakhs for basic setup
- **Hardware Procurement**: 2-3 months lead time
- **Depreciation**: 20% annual depreciation
- **Upgrade Costs**: Complete hardware replacement every 3-4 years

#### 2. Operational Challenges
- **24/7 Monitoring**: Required dedicated staff
- **Maintenance Windows**: Planned downtime every weekend
- **Security Updates**: Manual patching causing service interruptions
- **Backup Management**: Daily manual backups to external drives

#### 3. Scalability Limitations
- **Fixed Capacity**: Over-provisioning for peak loads
- **Scaling Time**: 2-3 weeks to add new servers
- **Resource Wastage**: 70% idle capacity during off-peak hours
- **Geographic Limitations**: Single location serving global users

#### 4. Reliability Issues
- **Single Point of Failure**: No redundancy in initial setup
- **Power Outages**: 4-6 hours monthly downtime
- **Hardware Failures**: Disk failures causing data loss
- **Network Issues**: ISP dependency for connectivity

#### 5. Cost Structure Problems
```
Monthly Costs (Traditional Setup - 2019):
├── Server Hardware Lease: ₹25,000
├── Bandwidth (1 Gbps): ₹50,000
├── Electricity: ₹15,000
├── Cooling/AC: ₹8,000
├── Security: ₹12,000
├── IT Staff (2 people): ₹80,000
├── Backup Storage: ₹5,000
└── Total: ₹1,95,000/month
```

#### 6. Performance Bottlenecks
- **Latency**: 200-500ms for international users
- **Concurrent Users**: Maximum 500 users simultaneously
- **Video Streaming**: Buffering issues during peak hours
- **Database Performance**: Slow queries during high load

### Real Incidents at MyLearning.com

#### Incident 1: The JEE Crash (March 2020)
- **Situation**: 2,000 students attempted mock test simultaneously
- **Impact**: Server crashed for 6 hours
- **Root Cause**: Insufficient RAM and CPU resources
- **Business Impact**: Lost 500 premium subscribers, ₹5 lakh revenue loss

#### Incident 2: The Monsoon Disaster (July 2019)
- **Situation**: Data center flooded during heavy rains
- **Impact**: 48 hours complete outage
- **Root Cause**: Poor disaster recovery planning
- **Business Impact**: Reputation damage, 1,000 users churned

#### Incident 3: The Backup Failure (December 2019)
- **Situation**: Hard disk crash with corrupted backups
- **Impact**: Lost 2 weeks of user progress data
- **Root Cause**: Untested backup restoration process
- **Business Impact**: Legal issues, compensation claims

### Traditional Infrastructure Limitations Summary

| Aspect | Traditional Challenge | Business Impact |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Scalability** | Manual, time-consuming | Missed opportunities |
| **Reliability** | Single points of failure | User dissatisfaction |
| **Cost** | High fixed costs | Reduced profitability |
| **Performance** | Limited by hardware | Poor user experience |
| **Security** | Manual updates | Vulnerability exposure |
| **Innovation** | Focus on maintenance | Slower feature delivery |
| **Global Reach** | Geographic constraints | Limited market expansion |

### The Realization

By late 2020, MyLearning.com founders realized:

1. **60% of IT budget** spent on infrastructure maintenance
2. **Only 40% of server capacity** utilized on average
3. **2-3 weeks lead time** for any infrastructure changes
4. **15-20% monthly downtime** affecting user trust
5. **Limited innovation** due to infrastructure focus

This realization led them to explore cloud computing as a solution to transform their business and focus on core competencies rather than infrastructure management.
