```

### The Growing Demands
As MyLearning.com's user base exploded to 3 million students, the limitations of static content became painfully obvious:

*"We're getting 500+ support tickets daily asking for features we simply can't build with static websites!"* - Priya (CPO)

### The Breaking Point Incident
The moment of truth came during a live doubt-solving session in March 2023:

**3:00 PM**: 50,000 students logged in for a live physics session
**3:05 PM**: Students started asking questions in the chat
**3:10 PM**: Instructor tried to respond but had no way to interact
**3:15 PM**: Students complained about lack of real-time features
**3:30 PM**: Session ended with 2.1/5 rating due to poor interactivity
**4:00 PM**: 1,000+ negative reviews posted on social media

*"We realized we had built a beautiful brochure, but our users needed a classroom!"* - Raj (CTO)

## Chapter 34: Understanding Virtualization and EC2 (March 2023)

### Discovering Amazon EC2
During an AWS webinar, Raj learned about Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):

*"EC2 is like having a computer in the cloud that you can turn on, configure, and use just like a physical machine, but without buying, installing, or maintaining any hardware!"* - AWS Presenter

### The Virtualization Foundation
To understand EC2 better, the team dove deep into how AWS creates and manages virtual machines:

### The Team's Realization
*"So AWS has essentially created a massive, global computer that we can rent by the hour, and it's more powerful and reliable than anything we could ever build ourselves!"* - Priya

*"And the best part is, we can start small and grow as our user base grows, without having to predict our future needs!"* - Amit

*"This means we can focus on building great educational experiences instead of managing servers!"* - Raj
