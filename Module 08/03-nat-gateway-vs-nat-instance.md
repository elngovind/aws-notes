# NAT Gateway vs NAT Instance

## Chapter 47: Solving the Internet Access Dilemma (October 2023)

### The Private Subnet Challenge
With the VPC architecture in place, Raj faced a new challenge: how to provide internet access to private subnet resources for software updates and external API calls, while maintaining security isolation.

*"Our application servers need to download updates and call external APIs, but we can't give them public IP addresses. That's where NAT comes in—it's like having a secure proxy that lets our private resources talk to the internet without exposing them."* - Amit (Lead Developer)

│   │   ├── Internal port → External port mapping
│   │   ├── Connection state tracking
│   │   └── Return traffic routing
│   ├── Connection Tracking
│   │   ├── Maintain translation table

│   │   ├── Handle connection timeouts
│   │   └── Manage port allocations
│   └── Security Benefits
│       ├── Inbound connections blocked by default
│       ├── Internal network topology hidden
│       ├── Centralized internet access control
│       └── Logging and monitoring capabilities
├── NAT Types
│   ├── Static NAT: One-to-one IP mapping
│   ├── Dynamic NAT: Pool of public IPs
│   ├── PAT (Port Address Translation): Many-to-one with ports
│   └── AWS NAT: Managed PAT with high availability
└── AWS NAT Solutions
    ├── NAT Gateway: Fully managed AWS service
    ├── NAT Instance: Self-managed EC2 instance
    ├── Internet Gateway: For public subnets only
    └── VPC Endpoints: For AWS services (no internet)
