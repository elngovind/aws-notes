# Module 8: AWS Networking and VPC Fundamentals

## The Network Foundation: Building MyLearning.com's Secure Infrastructure

### Module Overview
As MyLearning.com scales to serve 100,000+ users globally, Raj realizes that their current default VPC setup is becoming a security and scalability bottleneck. This module chronicles their journey from basic networking to a sophisticated, multi-tier VPC architecture that provides security, scalability, and compliance.

*"We thought networking was just about connecting servers. But as we grew, we learned that networking is the foundation of security, performance, and compliance. A well-designed VPC is like a well-planned city—everything flows better."* - Raj (CTO)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
- Master IP addressing concepts and CIDR notation
- Understand AWS VPC components and architecture
- Design secure multi-tier network architectures
- Implement subnets, route tables, and gateways
- Configure NAT Gateways and NAT Instances
- Build and deploy applications in custom VPCs
