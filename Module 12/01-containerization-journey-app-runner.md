# The Containerization Journey: AWS App Runner

## MyLearning.com's Deployment Evolution Crisis

### The Scaling Complexity Challenge
After successfully implementing CloudTrail for compliance, MyLearning.com faced a new challenge. Their application had grown significantly, and their traditional EC2-based deployment was becoming increasingly complex and expensive.

```
From: sarah.chen@mylearning.com (CTO)
To: dev-team@mylearning.com
Subject: Urgent: Deployment Pipeline Overhaul Needed

Team,

Our current deployment process is becoming unsustainable:

CURRENT ISSUES:
- 45-minute deployment cycles
- Manual server provisioning and configuration
- Inconsistent environments (dev vs prod differences)
- High infrastructure costs ($8,000/month for underutilized servers)
- Scaling delays during traffic spikes
- Developer productivity bottlenecks

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Lost revenue during deployment downtime
- Customer complaints about slow feature releases
- Developer burnout from deployment complexity
- Competitive disadvantage in time-to-market

We need a modern, containerized solution that can:
1. Deploy applications in minutes, not hours
2. Scale automatically based on demand
3. Reduce infrastructure costs by 60%
4. Eliminate environment inconsistencies
5. Enable rapid feature delivery

Research containerization options ASAP.

Sarah

## Introduction to Containerization

### What Are Containers?
Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring consistent execution across different environments.

```
Container vs Traditional Deployment:
├── Traditional Deployment
│   ├── Application runs directly on OS
│   ├── Shared system libraries and dependencies
│   ├── Environment-specific configurations
│   ├── "Works on my machine" problems
│   └── Resource overhead from full OS
├── Container Deployment
│   ├── Application packaged with dependencies
│   ├── Isolated runtime environment
│   ├── Consistent across dev/staging/prod
│   ├── Portable across different platforms
│   └── Efficient resource utilization
└── Container Benefits
    ├── Consistency across environments
    ├── Faster deployment and scaling
    ├── Better resource utilization
    ├── Simplified dependency management
    └── Enhanced developer productivity
```

## MyLearning.com's App Runner Implementation

### Phase 1: Application Containerization
The development team started by containerizing their Node.js application:

```dockerfile
# MyLearning.com Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001

# Change ownership of app directory
RUN chown -R nextjs:nodejs /app
USER nextjs

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1

# Start application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Phase 2: App Runner Service Configuration
```yaml
# apprunner.yaml - App Runner Configuration
version: 1.0
runtime: docker
build:
  commands:
    build:
      - echo "Building MyLearning.com application"
      - docker build -t mylearning-app .
run:
  runtime-version: latest
  command: npm start
  network:
    port: 3000
    env: PORT
  env:
    - name: NODE_ENV
