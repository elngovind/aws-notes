## 🛠️ Hands-On Implementation Examples

### Lab 1: Automated Backup System
```python
# Create comprehensive backup system
backup_manager = SnapshotManager()

# Configure backup policies
backup_policies = {
    'critical': {'frequency': '4h', 'retention': '30d'},
    'production': {'frequency': '2h', 'retention': '90d'},
    'development': {'frequency': '1d', 'retention': '7d'}
}

# Implement automated backups
for policy_name, config in backup_policies.items():
    result = backup_manager.create_backup_policy(
        policy_name=policy_name,
        frequency=config['frequency'],
        retention=config['retention']
    )
    print(f"Backup policy '{policy_name}': {result['Status']}")
```

### Lab 2: Comprehensive Encryption
```python
# Implement end-to-end encryption
encryption_manager = EncryptionManager()

# Create customer-managed keys
key_result = encryption_manager.create_customer_managed_key(
    key_description="MyLearning Production Encryption",
    key_usage="ENCRYPT_DECRYPT"
)

# Encrypt existing volumes
encryption_result = encryption_manager.encrypt_existing_volumes(
    instance_ids=['i-1234567890abcdef0'],
    kms_key_id=key_result['KeyId']
)

# Enable encryption by default
default_result = encryption_manager.enable_ebs_encryption_by_default()
print(f"Encryption implementation: {encryption_result['Summary']}")
```

### Lab 3: Cross-Account AMI Sharing
```python
# Set up cross-account collaboration
