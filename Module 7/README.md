# Module 7: Load Balancing and Auto Scaling

## The Scaling Challenge: MyLearning.com's Growth Story

### Module Overview
As MyLearning.com experiences explosive growth from 1,000 to 50,000+ concurrent users, Raj and his team face the ultimate scaling challenge. This module chronicles their journey from single-server architecture to a robust, auto-scaling, load-balanced infrastructure that can handle millions of users.

*"We went from celebrating our first 100 users to panicking about 10,000 users crashing our server in just three months. That's when we learned that success without scalability is just delayed failure."* - Raj (CTO)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the critical need for load balancing in modern applications
- Master AWS Load Balancer types: ALB, NLB, CLB, and GLB
- Implement comprehensive auto scaling strategies
- Design launch templates and auto scaling groups
- Configure scaling policies for different scenarios
- Implement predictive scaling and scheduled actions
